# Coomon Task: Multi-class Classification

### Dataset Description:

The Dataset consists of three classes, strong lensing images with no substructure, subhalo substructure, and vortex substructure. The images have been normalized using min-max normalization. Train set has 30k images and val set has 7.5k images

### Task 
To build a model for classifying the images into lenses using PyTorch or Keras.

For this task I trained following models:
- ResNet18
- DenseNet161
- Ensamble of these two models

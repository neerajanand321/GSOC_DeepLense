# ML4SCI GSOC Task

This GitHub repository contains two Folders, each of which focuses on a different deep learning task.

## Common Task

The notebook in Common Task demonstrates a simple image classification task using a convolutional neural network (Transfer Learning). The dataset used in this notebook is the one provided for common task, which is a collection of strong lensing image. The notebook includes all the necessary code to load the dataset, preprocess the images, define the CNN model, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## LensFinding 

The LensFinding folder has two notebooks focuses on a more specialized deep learning task, namely identifying gravitational lenses in astronomical images. Gravitational lenses are objects in space that bend light, causing distant objects to appear distorted. Detecting gravitational lenses is important for understanding the structure and distribution of matter in the universe. The notebook includes all the necessary code to load the dataset, preprocess the images, define the CNN model, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Exploring Transformers

The notebook in this folder demonstrates the use of a vision transformer method to build a robust and efficient model for binary classification on provided dataset.


## Dependencies

To run the notebooks, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PyTorch

You can install these dependencies using pip or conda.
